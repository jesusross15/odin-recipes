    <h2>Every Friday night is burger night at our house!</h2>
    <p>The tomatoes add fresh flavor 
        and the cool spinach dip brings it all together. We often skip the buns and serve these over a bed of grilled cabbage.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 large egg, lightly beaten</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons fat-free milk </li>
        <li>1/2 cup soft bread crumbs</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon dried basil</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon pepper</li>
        <li>1 pound lean ground beef (90% lean)</li>
        <li>4 whole wheat hamburger buns, split</li>
        <li>1/4 cup spinach dip</li>
        <li>1/4 cup julienned soft sun-dried tomatoes (not packed in oil)</li>
        <li>Lettuce leaves</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Directions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Combine first 6 ingredients. Add beef; mix lightly but thoroughly. Shape into four 1/2-in.-thick patties.</li>
        <li>Place burgers on an oiled grill rack or in a greased 15x10x1-in. pan. Grill, covered, over medium heat or broil 4-5 in. from heat until a thermometer reads 160Â°, 4-5 minutes per side. 
            Grill buns, cut side down, over medium heat until toasted. Serve burgers on buns; top with spinach dip, tomatoes and lettuce.</li>
    </ol>

    <h4>Tips</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>To make soft bread crumbs, tear bread into pieces and place in a food processor or blender. Cover and pulse until crumbs form. One slice of bread yields 1/2 to 3/4 cup crumbs. 
            This recipe was tested with sun-dried tomatoes that do not need to be soaked before use.</li>
        <li>Using lean ground beef instead of beef that's 80% lean saves 45 calories per 4-ounce serving of beef. Lean ground beef is also 29% lower in saturated fat.</li>
    </ul>
