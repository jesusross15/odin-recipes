    <h2>This Is For All The Big Sushi Fans</h2>
    <p>I'm a big sushi fan, but I don't always have time to make those intricate rolls at home. 
        This jar is layered with my favorite California roll ingredients, so I can get the flavor I love without the fuss. </p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup uncooked sushi rice</li>
        <li>1 cup water</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon rice vinegar</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon sugar</li>
        <li>2 medium ripe avocados peeled and cubed</li>
        <li>1 cup lump crabmeat, drained</li>
        <li>1 cup chopped cucumber</li>
        <li>2 nori sheets, thinly sliced</li>
        <li>Optional toppings: pickled ginger slices, 
            soy sauce and toasted sesame seeds</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Directions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Wash rice in a colander until water runs clear. Combine rice, 1 cup water and salt in a large saucepan; bring to a boil. Reduce heat; cover. 
            Simmer until water is absorbed and rice is tender, 15-20 minutes. 
            Remove from heat. Let stand 10 minutes. Combine rice vinegar and sugar, stirring until sugar is dissolved. Stir into rice.</li>
        <li>Place 1/3 cup rice into each of four 1-pint wide-mouth canning jars; layer with half of the avocados, crabmeat, cucumber and nori. Top with remaining rice and repeat layers. 
            Cover and refrigerate until serving. Transfer into bowls; toss to combine. Serve with toppings as desired.</li>
    </ol>

    <h4>Tips</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Imitation crabmeat is a very acceptable substitution for the more costly lump crabmeat. Tuna fish, smoked salmon or smoked trout are also good replacements for the crab.
        </li>
        <li>Have fun and add other ingredients you like, such as matchstick carrots or cubed cream cheese!</li>
        <li>To keep avocados green, toss in rice vinegar before layering.</li>
    </ul>
