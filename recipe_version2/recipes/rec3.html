    <h2>Who Doesn't Love Mexican Food?</h2>
    <p>My best friend is of Mexican heritage, and I've watched his make this crunchy beef burrito recipe for years. 
        The very first time I made them for my own family, they instantly became a favorite meal. They're even better warmed up the next day in the microwave. </p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 pound ground beef</li>
        <li>1 envelope taco seasoning</li>
        <li>1 can (16 ounces) refried beans</li>
        <li>6 flour tortillas (12 inches), warmed</li>
        <li>1 cup shredded Colby-Monterey Jack cheese</li>
        <li>4 teaspoons canola oil</li>
        <li>Sour cream and salsa</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Directions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>In a large cast-iron or other heavy skillet, cook beef over medium heat until no longer pink; drain. 
            Stir in taco seasoning; remove from skillet and set aside. Wipe skillet clean.</li>
        <li>In a small saucepan, cook refried beans over medium-low heat until heated through, 2-3 minutes.</li>
        <li>Spoon about 1/3 cup of beans off-center on each tortilla; top with 1/4 cup beef mixture. Sprinkle with cheese. 
            Fold sides and ends of tortillas over filling and roll up.</li>
        <li>In same skillet over medium-high heat, brown burritos in oil on all sides. Serve with sour cream and salsa.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Can You Freeze Them?</h3>
    <p>Individually wrap cooled burritos in paper towels and foil; freeze in a freezer container. To use, remove foil; place paper towel-wrapped burrito on a microwave-safe plate. 
        Microwave on high until heated through, turning once, 3-4 minutes. Let stand 20 seconds.</p>

    <h4>Tips</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>For some additional heat, stir in ½ tsp. crushed red pepper flakes or ¼ tsp. ground cayenne pepper when adding the taco seasoning. 
            Don't have any taco seasoning on hand? Make its copycat spice blend.</li>
        <li>Burritos can be a well-rounded meal if not over-stuffed. To lighten them up, make homemade burritos with lean ground sirloin, fat-free refried beans,
             reduced-fat cheese and light sour cream or non-fat plain Greek yogurt.</li>
    </ul>
